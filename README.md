## Hello!

I'm [Alex Watt](https://alexcwatt.com/). My work, in a nutshell: I make ideas come to life, sometimes with code. I love the whole process - from ideation to implementation. I get great satisfaction from learning and from shipping.

You can learn more about my work on [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alexcwatt) and more about me on [my website](https://alexcwatt.com/about/).
